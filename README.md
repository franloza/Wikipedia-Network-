#What is Wikispeedia Network?
Wikispeedia Network is a web application that allows to visualize and interact with network
data corresponding to navigation paths on Wikipedia, collected through the human-computation game Wikispeedia. Just look for a
word and see!

#Data sources
For this project I've used the dataset available at SNAP webpage [SNAP webpage](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html)  

In [Wikispeedia] (http://cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/), users are asked to navigate from a given source to a given target article, by only clicking Wikipedia links.
I have transformed the dataset in two JSON files with the edges and nodes of the network. The original dataset contains a condensed 
version of Wikipedia (4,604 articles).
